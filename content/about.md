## Professional approach and experience

[I consider myself to be a person who is open-minded, curious, and engaging. I continuously strive to improve and become a better therapist.]{.lead}

As a psychologist educated and licensed in Norway, I've spent several years working in Norway at mental health care polyclinics for children and adolescents. I've worked in teams specializing in assertively meeting the mental health needs of marginalized adolescents and their families.

I appreciate collaborating with clients who experience difficulties in relationships with their peers or their close ones. After several sessions, several of my clients testify having a better understanding and control of their own emotions; feeling better equipped to face relational challenges, caring for themselves in more self-sustainable ways, and more constructively expressing their concerns and needs to their close ones.

<!-- ### Who am I

In my spare time, I enjoy diving/snorkeling, bouldering, and gaming. I've got attention difficulties (ADD); searching for ways to optimize my productivity has ironically become the primary reason for my procrastinating tendencies.

I live together with my two spoiled princesses, Melody, and Maki. After having lived together in Norway for four years we moved to Singapore. Singapore was the obvious choice for us both - Melody, who is Taiwanese, missed the Chinese cuisine, and I was eager to immerse myself in a new culture while still being able to work as a psychologist in English. I've been trying to learn and improve my Chinese on and off for years, but I couldn't express half of what I can comprehend when listening.

## About this website

After moving to Singapore during the first quarter of 2022, I realized that I want to share more of my life; both with friends and family back home, but also with new friends and acquaintances globally. Furthermore, since Singaporean work culture makes the American dream seem dull and unambitious, relocating was the final push I needed to start actively promoting my niche overlapping interests of psychology & programming. I aim to share both personal and professional reflections, and I will post on LinkedIn when I do.

**Why *.best* domain?** First and foremost, I wanted something memorable. I hope that you got a strong emotional reaction when reading [werner.best](http://werner.best). Be it surprise, pleasure, confusion, or resentment - Either way, your strong reaction will probably make you remember. Secondly, it's an opportunistic and calculated decision with the shameless aim toward ranking higher on search engines, like when potential clients search for "Best psychologist Singapore". Note, however, that I am by no means the best psychologist, but I do aspire to continuously improve and hone my skills. The final consideration for choosing a domain was the price, and as no one in their right mind would consider getting such a pretentious and self-glorifying domain, it was by far the cheaper option.
